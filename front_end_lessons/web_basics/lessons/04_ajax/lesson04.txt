Part 4: Ajax
- Goal: Add in the Ajax calls to make the app functional
- More info about client-server architecture (cors)
- More on promises and binding

Notes:
- Need to set up CORS on API: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-3.1
- Need to bind handlers AFTER ajax call
- GET and DELETE are straightforward
- Add a new PUT call to the API /{id}/complete
- Need to add some more info for the POST (ContentType)
