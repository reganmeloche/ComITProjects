Part 5: CSS
- Goal: Make the web application look nice
- Learn basics of css
- Start by adding it inline, then move to style tag in the page, then move to separate file
- Make everything look nice and organized. Create some common styling for both pages
- Center the title, organize the table, make the form nicer to use
- Make all the buttons and inputs nicer 
- Common styling for the nav button

Notes:
- The functionality is still the same even if we remove the css.
- We've now separated 3 pieces: The styling, the functionality, and the layout
- forms are quite difficult to get right
- Major problem: Scaling for mobile and other screen sizes
