Goal: 
- Introduce the fundamental front-end web technologies, building up to the .NET MVC framework. 
- By this point we will have learned how to build a working RESTful API that we can query from something like Postman. 
- A front-end web application gives our users a nice usable interface so that they donâ€™t need to make calls to Postman anytime they want to do anything.

Prerequisites: 
- Understanding of: Web architecture, http, REST, coding basics
- We will also have a simple Todo REST api set up and running locally

Summary
- We have a fully working website. Walk through and summarize all the pieces.
- Talk about the next steps we would take to actually deploy this and get it online
- Code organization: Separating logic, style, and layout
- What is missing? Validation, authentication,...
- Drawbacks: lack of type-safety due to using javascript, somewhat tedious, ...

Moving to MVC
- Discuss the components of MVC and compare to our first approach
- Learn about .NET implementation of MVC
- Build a MVC web application using tools such as scaffolding
- Compare the final result of the MVC site to our first approach
