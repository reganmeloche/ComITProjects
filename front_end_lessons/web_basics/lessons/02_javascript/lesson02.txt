Part 2: JavaScript
- Goal: Use JavaScript to interact with HTML
- Code refresher: variables, functions, etc.
- Intro and background on JavaScript. Compare with C#
- Intro to the DOM - add ids and classes to HTML elements
- Hook up a simple button, and fill in some info
- Populate the table using a mock list of tasks
- Add buttons that just output the action to the console
- Add a form that just outputs the new todo item to the console
- Important concept: We've started to separate the functionality from the layout
