Part 6: Bootstrap
- Goal: Replace our styling with Bootstrap
- Include cdns, add meta tag in head
- Add container, rows, and columns. Learn about the grid system
- Move the table and form to the same page. Easier to use
- Format the table - big win for a couple classes (also table-striped, table-bordered, ...)
- Add classes to the form
- Buttons: success and danger (need to go into the ajax page to edit)
- Navbar

Notes:
- Goal isn't to do a deep dive into bootstrap. Just want to show its power
- Downside? html page gets a bit more complicated. Lots of divs
