Vehicle fixes:
- Vehicle needs to be abstract
- Vehicle._isMoving should be protected
- Vehicle constructor should not have a type on it
- CanWeAllFit should take in a STRING array
- Bonus: CanWeAllFit could be a one-line function
- virtual func StartMoving needs void type
- no need for override on virtual StopMoving functions
- abstract functions must be public
- SlowDown should not have a body of any sort

Bicycle fixes:
- Must inherit from Vehicle
- CurrentSpeed should be a private setter
- NumberOfBikes must be public and static
- "Mountain" must be a valid bike type
- valid bike type needs a NOT (!)
- invalid bike type should throw exception, not a Console.WriteLine
- StartMoving and StopMoving also need overrides to set the CurrentSpeed
- SpeedUp and SlowDown need override keyword
- SpeedUp should check if _isMoving first
- Slowdown should be SlowDown
- SlowDown sign should be > 1, not > 0
