To show the real benefit of interfaces, I should use the QuizBuilder example. Or maybe just the WordCounter
- Take in some text
- Count the words
- Print out a summary

- use a list first to see the result
- then justify the dictionary
- that way we can do another interface!

- they re-use the punctuation stripper. Should probably inject that  in
