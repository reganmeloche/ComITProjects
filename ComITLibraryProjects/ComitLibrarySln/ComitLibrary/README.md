## ComIT Library

This is a sample project for a simple book library. It consists of patrons, books, and loans. 

Patrons are able to checkout a book, which will create a loan. They can then return the book, which will mark the loan as being returned.

Users of the application can also search the book database, list all of the books, and list all of the patrons.
